# Camera Face Detection and Recognition App

This is a simple **real-time face detection and recognition** application built using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces from the live camera feed.
- **Face Recognition**: Compares detected faces with pre-encoded faces from the `images` folder and identifies known individuals.
- **Tkinter GUI**: Provides a graphical user interface to display the live video feed.
- **Add New Faces**: Add new face images to the `images` folder, and the application will automatically process them for recognition.

## Dependencies
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `Pillow`
- `screeninfo`
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation and Running the App
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
